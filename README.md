A simple script to defeat textual captchas

Since the Internet lost its virginity, got invaded by bots and invented CAPTCHA,
clueless people have been trying to create simpler tests for users to prove their humanity.

All of them fail, usually. One textbook example is http://textcaptcha.com/ which I provide a simple
script to defeat.

FAQ:
- Your script does not solve ALL captchas. You are a fraud, sir, why do you hate people so much?
- Yes, I parse only the simplest cases presented and that is absolutely enough. A rate of 1/5 captchas solved
combined with brute force will get bots through. Remember, a bot will only need 5 attempts on average and computers
are very good at retrying patiently.
